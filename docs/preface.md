Before reading this article, please first understand [the difference between CSP and OI](/zh_cn/csp/).

Currently, competitions like CSP and OI are experiencing a significant trend of younger participation. Some students (primary and secondary school students) may not genuinely want to compete, but are still persuaded by their parents to attend training and participate in these contests.

As netizens have pointed out:
```
It was them who ruined the Luogu discussion forum.

It was them who turned CSP exam halls into chaos.

It was them who made CCF restrict the age for CSP participation.

Forcing growth is not a good thing.
