Having dreams and goals is a good thing. If you feel that participating in these competitions will improve your programming skills, or if you're doing it to exercise your thinking, and it benefits you, then go for it. You're already better than 90% of people (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧

1. Misaligned Goals

If your goal is simply to learn programming (just to learn C++), then I do not recommend this path. Most students learn C++ and participate in these competitions because their parents require it, attracted by one key feature: assisting further education.

However, with the competition becoming more common among younger age groups and participant numbers increasing, the difficulty of achieving significant success in these competitions for educational advancement has greatly increased<sup>[1]</sup> *(CSP-J/S data referenced here)*.

2. Suitability Issues

Any competition *(not limited to these)* has an appropriate target audience. Some parents, "for the sake of" their children's future, force them to learn and participate, potentially increasing pressure (especially during crucial study years) and leading to ineffective efforts with suboptimal results.

3. Non-Standard C++ Practices

Training institutions for these competitions often teach non-standard C++ syntax. While boosting coding speed, such OIer-style practices become difficult to unlearn for formal C++ development<sup>[2]</sup>:

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>  // Non-standard "universal header"
using namespace std;     // Potentially problematic namespace usage
int main()
{
    return 0;
}
```
The above exemplifies OIer-style code with non-standard practices like the "universal header" (`bits/stdc++.h`).

4. High Investment, Low Return

Setting aside self-study, such training programs are typically expensive. Yet significant competition achievements are never guaranteed despite the investment<sup>[3]</sup>.
