# CSP vs OI

> This document contains generated by AI for reference and learning purposes only.

Core Positioning Differences

| Dimension | CSP (Computer Software Professional) | OI (Olympiad in Informatics) |
|----------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Organizer | China Computer Federation (CCF) | China Computer Federation (CCF) |
| Nature | Software competency certification exam for professionals and university students | Informatics Olympiad targeting middle and high school students |
| Target Audience | University students, working developers, programming enthusiasts | Students from junior to senior high school engaged in programming competitions |
| Primary Goal | Assess programming and algorithmic engineering skills for employment and academic advancement | Identify and cultivate elite talent for national and international informatics competitions, including IOI selection |

Examination Format and Content Evolution (2020–2025)

| Year | CSP Changes | OI Changes |
|------|-------------|------------|
| 2020 | CSP-S expanded from 3 to 4 programming problems, aligning with NOIP | NOIP transitioned to full machine testing; eliminated written exams |
| 2022 | Introduced partial scoring to reward logically correct but incomplete solutions | Increased emphasis on data structures and graph theory; reduced pure math problems |
| 2024 | Enhanced scoring weight for code robustness, especially boundary condition handling | Provincial selection adopted unified multi-province problem sets and NOI Linux 2.0 evaluation environment |
| 2025 | Added real-world engineering scenarios: file I/O, multi-threading simulation | Piloted interactive problems (Interactive Problem) mirroring IOI style |

Scoring and Evaluation Mechanisms

| Aspect | CSP | OI |
|--------|-----|----|
| Evaluation Method | Fully automated judging system based on multiple test cases | Fully automated judging with point-based test cases; each problem split into independent test points |
| Scoring System | Programming questions total 75 points; partial credit awarded for passing subsets of test cases | Each test point carries fixed points (e.g., 2–4); full score only if all points passed — no process-based partial credit |
| Evaluation Criteria | Correctness, time complexity, and space complexity; TLE or MLE results in zero points | Same as CSP, but with stronger emphasis on algorithmic optimality; brute-force solutions rarely achieve full marks |
| Feedback Mechanism | No real-time feedback during exam; results released post-exam | International formats (e.g., IOI) offer real-time feedback (AC/WA/RE/TLE); domestic NOIP/CSP-S remain post-exam only |
| Scoring Transparency | CCF publishes national baseline scores (e.g., 131 for CSP-S Level 1 in 2025); provincial cutoffs adjusted dynamically | NOIP award thresholds use “baseline +浮动” model: national first-prize baseline at ~20%, with provincial adjustments to maintain ranking consistency |

```

- Provincial Selection (2025): Guangdong uses weighted scoring: NOIP (40%) + Provincial Round 1 (30%) + Provincial Round 2 (30%)
- National Team Selection: Top 50 from NOI National Final (held annually in July) enter the training pool; final 6 selected after multiple rounds of testing and winter camp evaluations
- Zhejiang Dominance: In 2025, 7 of 30 IOI预备队 members were from Zhejiang, with 4 from elite high schools in Hangzhou — many showed exceptional talent as early as middle school

Certification Value and Social Recognition

| Application | CSP Certificate | OI Award (NOIP First Prize or Higher) |
|-------------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| University Strong Foundation Programs | Recognized by some 985 universities (e.g., Huazhong UST) as important reference; may lower admission threshold by 1–2 tiers | Direct entry into Tsinghua, Peking, USTC, Zhejiang Univ. strong foundation programs; often exempt from preliminary exams |
| Comprehensive Evaluation Admissions | Accepted by provincial universities (e.g., HZDUT, ZJNU) for CSP-S First Prize; offers score reduction benefits | NOIP First Prize is a core credential; dominates “Trinity Admission” systems |
| Corporate Recruitment | Baidu, Huawei, Tencent use CSP scores to screen interns; high scorers fast-tracked to interviews | National training team members are directly hired; salaries exceed ¥500k/year; targeted under “Genius Youth” programs |
| College Entrance Bonus | No provincial unified bonus policy | Multiple provinces (including Zhejiang) grant college entrance exam bonus points or direct admission to NOIP First Prize winners |
